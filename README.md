32-bit Operating System written in x86 assembly.

## Philosophy

Nowaday, all Software are overengineered bloatware. So let's try to keep things simple, stupid. 

## Building

```
$ sudo apt install build-essential fasm mtools
$ git clone https://git.cute.engineering/d0p1/StupidOS.git
$ cd StupidOS
$ make
```

Pretty easy, isn't it?
